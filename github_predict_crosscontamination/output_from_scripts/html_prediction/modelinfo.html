                                    <p> To predict contamination a voting classifier was choosen.
                                        This model uses an ensemble learning approach that combines the strengths of multiple
                                        classifiers to boost accuracy and robustness.
                                        The ensemble uses:
                                         <ul>
                                            <li>
                                                <a>Random Forest – reduces overfitting by averaging multiple decision trees.</a>
                                            </li>
                                            <li>
                                                <a>Extra Trees Classifier – adds randomness to improve model diversity.</a>
                                            </li>

                                                <a>XGBoost – a high-performance gradient boosting framework.</a>
                                            </li>
                                            <li>
                                                <a>Gradient Boosting – builds models sequentially to fix previous errors.</a>
                                            </li>
                                            <li>
                                                <a>Bagging Classifier – trains base learners on different subsets to lower variance.</a>
                                            </li>
                                        </ul>
                                        <b>How it works:</b>
                                        <br>
                                        The voting classifier works by combining the predictions of several base models.
                                        Each model trained with different learning techniques. In this setup, Random
                                        Forest, Extra Trees, XGBoost, Gradient Boosting, and a Bagging Classifier each
                                        make their own prediction on whether a virus sample is contaminated.
                                        Instead of choosing one model, the voting classifier brings together all
                                        predictions using a voting strategy:
                                        In soft voting (used here), the model averages the probability estimates from
                                        all classifiers and chooses the class with the highest overall confidence. This
                                        allows stronger, more confident models to have a greater influence on the final
                                        decision.

                                        By using multiple perspectives, the ensemble reduces the risk of errors from any
                                        single model. It improves reliability, balances bias and variance, and performs
                                        especially well on complex or imbalanced datasets like this biological
                                        contamination samples dataset with only 6% of the dataset containing
                                        contamination.</p><br>

                                            <p>
                                            The confusion matrix in Figure 1 illustrates the number of true positives,
                                            true negatives, false positives, and false negatives predicted by the voting
                                            classifier.
                                            From this matrix, three key performance metrics were derived:
                                            </p>
                                            <ul>
                                                <li><strong>F1 Score (0.934)</strong> – A balance between precision and recall, especially important in imbalanced datasets like this one. A high F1 score shows the model is effectively detecting contaminated viruses without too many false positives.</li>
                                                <li><strong>Matthews Correlation Coefficient (MCC: 0.54)</strong> – A more balanced evaluation that takes into account all four confusion matrix categories. It’s a good overall indicator of model quality, especially when class sizes differ.</li>
                                                <li><strong>Accuracy (93%)</strong> – The proportion of total correct predictions. While useful, it can be misleading with imbalanced data, so it’s best interpreted alongside F1 and MCC.</li>
                                            </ul>
                                            <p>
                                            Together, these scores confirm that the voting classifier performs reliably across both contaminated and non-contaminated virus samples.
                                            </p>
                                            <br>
                                            <p>The ROC AUC score is a valuable metric to assess the classifier's ability to distinguish between contaminated and non-contaminated viruses across various thresholds.
                                            This model achieved an AUC of <strong>0.89</strong>, indicating excellent discriminative performance.
                                            Figure 2 shows the ROC curve, where the closer the curve follows the top-left corner, the better the performance.</p>
